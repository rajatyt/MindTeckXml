 Images carousel: when user swipe left or right, list content
should change accordingly. The images carousel can
handle any number of images.

 The list: when user scrolls up the whole page should scroll
with it. The list can handle any number of items.
P.S. images and list content can be local or loaded from
the internet.

 Search: Search bar should pin top when it reaches screen
top. When user enter text, it should filter the labels in the
list based on the user input.

 Floating action button should show a nice bottom sheet
dialog that contain a small statistic that consist of the
count of items for each page and show the top 3
occurrence character in the list. i.e
listOf(“apple”, “banana” , “orange”, “blueberry”)
List 1 (25 items)
a = 5
e = 4
r = 3

 Don’t use third party libraries. (You can use Android
support libraries)
